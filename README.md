## Description

- My motivation for making this project was to better understand how to work a javafile and use basic features, such as random numbers.   
- I made this to show my understanding of these topics.
- This solves my issues by giving me reference tool to go back and look into how to do these java issues.  
- The largest thing I learned from this project is how to correctly add a looping feature to look at my data.  

## Installation

I started this by first cloning the starter code into my repository that was given to me for this project.  I then spent all of my time working in the javascript file to make this work.  I actually misunderstood the prompt at first and worked for around four hours trying to make my code work.  Only after completely stumbling on that, I reread the prompt, realized my mistake, then had to restart my entire project.  The good thing was that I actually was trying to make the project harder than it was.  The rest of the project flew for me once I know what I was looking for.
